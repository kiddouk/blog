title: How to improve your negociation skills

<p class="intro">Negociating is always a difficult thing at first. It requires guts, nerves and a certain sense of drive in order to get what you want. Things can go three ways, you push too hard and pisses everyone off and they leave the table, you dont get what you want or you end up making deal that feels right where everyone has to bleed a little in order to reach an agreement.</p>

As I mentioned before, [due to over work](http://sebastien.requiem.fr/2013/12/19/quit-your-startup-before-getting-sick.html), stress and [bad team management](http://sebastien.requiem.fr/2014/01/23/killing-the-ASAP-culture.html), I ended having to negociate my departure in a rather uncomfortable way. But I decided that I would learn the most out of it. The company was not making any revenue so I thought: "What the heck ? At least I will learn something new and see how I performed".

A bit of context:
--------------
I had around 10% of shares, that should have been vested over 4 years (and yearly). For the sake of this blog post, when I write 100%, I mean 100% of 10%. Meaning that 50% represents 5%, that 25% represents 2.5%. And so on.

July 2014 (1.5 year down the road), I expressed to my business partners that I would finish the year 2014 in order to secure 50% of my shares since this would represent 2 years of hard work.

Soon enough, they came back to me and asked me to leave right away, offered me 25% and one month salary.

### Rule #1 - Find someone to advise you ###

At that exact moment, I realized that not only my business partners where many and I was alone, but I was also sick and pretty ignorant about laws, negocitation and how things are working.

I hired a lawyer. This is the best advice I can only give you. Get a f*cking lawyer. Explain the clear truth to him/her and explain him that _you_ will do the negociation. You should only use his services to verify that you are aligned in term of rights and the law.

### Rule #2 - Take your time. ###

I really hoped to get that done very fast because it was hard mentally, that I was hesitant if I was right or just an asshole. Don't rush things. Take you time. What's the rush anyway ?

Explain clearly what you want to your business partners and decline all the previous offers they may have come with. If an offer come from them, know that it's probably not the best one ;) Negociation is not about accepting what people offer you. It's about getting what you want and being honest with yourself and the situation.

Take time to consider things like, what did I achieve? what should I be proud of? What do I expect from this deal? Is there anything that _they_ would enjoy?

Spend time to understand the other side's game. They are as in a hurry as you to close a deal. So make sure you understand what they will be sensitive to.

### Rule #3 - Beef up your game. ###

Now that you are surrounded by a good lawyer, that your head is clear and cold, it is time to shoot the first email. State _clearly_ what you want. Don't be ashamed to want things. Be fair. In my case, I knew I could have walked with 100% and 4 months of salary over sickness. Plain and simple (thank you lawyer!). But I didn't want to piss them off completely. They could have torn the company down, started another one without me on the base of my work and carry on.

Instead, I offered them something where they could save money (the senstive point) and give me less shares (they won on the money!). In reward I asked a couple of clauses where they can't create a new company in the same field without me, they can't dilute me in an unfair capital raise, and a couple of other things.

#### Why did I do that ? ####

I could have run for the money. But I started that company to see how it could go. It would have been stupid of me to piss everyone off, get the company closed and my efforts go into ashes. Also, our company got funded. So why not use the money and get the company continuing to employ people ? Stay true to your values. Always.

### Rule #4 - Don't trust people. ###

You will receive a lot of bullshit. I got it all, angry emails of "what should we do of this?", "I haven't received your previous email". Don't fall for the trap. Never ever reply to such thing. Ignore, and keep your eyes on the prize. Your prize.

In a back and forth email exchange, you will have to give a little back so they feel like they win something. This usually unlock situations. But for each thing that you give (shares, money, time, contractual clause), always make sure that you ask for something else. ALWAYS. In a negociation, nothing is given for free. the other side will not give you anything for free either ;)


### Rule #5 - It's not about winning, it's about what feels right. ###

Let's face it, you are in a conflict. So make sure that you walk away with what you think is fair. People on the other side will try to get what they think is fair. From there, use a bracketing strategy to negotiate your way down (i.e.: aim high and give back) instead of trying to climb your way up.


## Conclusion ##


I ended up in a situation that I find fair. Everyone bled a little. I didn't get 100% of my shares, but I didn't get 25% either ;) I receive partly some months of salary, but not the full 4 months. I got a couple of contractual clauses that protects me a little.

Remember one thing, once you leave (or are asked to leave) the company, you will not have access to as much information as you think you can. This will weaken your game. So make sure that you leave with the best contract you can. Then things will faltten out with time anyway.
