title: How I boost my productivity

<p class="intro">Every single developer want to be more productive. Here are my tips on how I increased mine.</p>

## Get rid of the annoying stuff ##

Do it. Just commit the *very first hour* of your day to get rid of everything that is on the way. It can be paying a simple bill, or that mail that you forgot to reply too or even that annoying administrative paper you have to fill up. The reason behind that tip is that it will free your mind. You won't have to think about it. It will free your mind. This is actually part of some Getting Things Done strategy that I played with a couple of years ago. I had no idea that this would be the most powerful tip I ever received. If after one hour, you haven't gotten rid of all the annoyance. Postpone the rest to the next day. And start again. Little by little, the list of annoying things will get out of the way. Say goodbye to the feeling of guilt, say goodbye to the thoughts of "Oh fuck, I still haven't filled up my tax papers!".

## Know you tools and improve them ##

You know it, I became a huge defender of emacs. Some people will tall you that you will spend more time configuring your emacs rather tahn coding. It's arguably true. But people tend to miss the point that by doing so, you are learning a new language *and* you are adapting the most precious tool you have to your needs (and not the opposite). While developing, there always has been some stuff that annoyed me. For example, I wanted a way to re-run my unittests automatically on my machine each time I modified more than 10% of a file. This is now history. My emacs does it, and report back to me only when things get dirty. I also like properly documented functions, so I made sure that I have the proper templates in place for function documentations upfront in my code using yasnippet.

## Use a offline TODO list ##

This one is tricky. I use the bullet journal at the moment to keep track of my TODO. I could have a fancy online tool that connects with my phone and so on. But I chose an offline / analogic TODO list for 2 reasons:

1. I want to be able to forget my TODO list.
2. I want to re-write tasks that I postpone because I lack time, input or simply because the task is too annoying.

Re-writing the tasks that you haven't done yesterday to your today's list gives your the real importance of a task. If you haven't done it, it may not be that important. Can it be postponed even further ? Or on the contrary, you realise that things will burn if you don't do that task this morning. Be e-writing, you re-asses the importance of a task.


## There is two level of importance only ##

I usually see people categorizing things like "not important", "not so important", "important", "very important", "urgent". This is the wrong way. It should be "to be done", "URGENT".
From now on, any "URGENT" task must be treating as the next coming task, dis-regarding the others. If it's urgent, it's your priority number#1. If it's "to be done" (that's why it's on your list after all, you have to do it as soon as there is no urgent matter. That's it. Don't spend 2 hours categorizing your tasks. You *know* if something is burning or not. Just take the estinguisher and kill the fire. Right away.
