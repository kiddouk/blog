# The practical guide to it freelancing, part 1 #

I have been freelancing in IT on and off for the last past 8 years. In the recent years, I met more and more people in the IT business that are interested in jumping into the freelance world. Most of them are regular employees in some tech company. Some of the biggest company and some from the smallest startup you can imagine. I am not entirely sure of what truly motivates all these people but my analytical brain can't stop trying to find a pattern.

A few weeks ago, I spent a bit of time thinking about how I could help anyone who is in doubt wether or not they should go freelance. This practical guide is here for this exact purpose. It is by no means a complete guide and should be approached with an open mindset as each individual situation can vary a lot from another one. I will try to compile in this series of posts all the information I wish I was told when I started myself.

We will talk about how to succeed as a freelancer, how to handle difficult clients, how to not fall in the many traps that will be on the road to your freelance success. This guide should also give some valuable strategy for people in regular employment too as most of the trouble in freelance is to position in a team that is already established and that either lack knowledge or direction in order to implement what should be implemented.

## Freelancing, what's in it for you ##

### Free as in freelance ###

While money is the primary aspect and stereotype of the freelancer, I decided to focus on other less known aspect of the freelance life. In the recent years, and due to the hype of startups, we are witnessing a change in how people work. We are more and more dependent on our computer for everyday work. That dependency is also what can make us free in some ways. Free to work from where we want. And this freedom of geolocation naturally some considerations about the other freedom too:

    * the freedom of work when we want
    * the freedom of working what we want
    * the freedom of not working when we dont want
    
Being a freelancer can help you to reach all of that, in very little time and with a few actionables. Some freelancers decide to sacrifice all of the above in order to earn a lot of money and retire early. I personally chose to use the money to buy some freedom that my friends cannot afford. You can measure your wealth by counting how many days you can afford not to work.

    Freelance and freedom are sharing the same first 4 letters.
    
### Having the right to say no ###

There are multiple ways to say no. No I dont want to work for you, No we should not deploy that crazy feature without testing it properly first, No I wont sacrifice everything in order to fit your agenda.

In all situation, being a freelancer should help you to express your concerns and issues independently of the hierarchy. This forces you to communicate in a proper way, state that you are the expert on the subject. If you have raised the warnings early enough and your customer decides to ignore it nonetheless then it is his problem. Not yours. Of course, you should be here to help fix the newly born pile of mess but the roles are very clear: you are here to help for THEIR problem, not yours.

Being hired for your expertise is a true enabler here as your peers will listen and value your advice and warning early on.

### Get the opportunity to work on some super cool projects ###

I have heard by some fellow freelancers that all they were doing was to work on the most boring projects – usually for banks – but the paycheck was so great that they kept at it for too long. I have worked a few time for a bank as a freelancer and I can tell you two things: I didn't get the most interesting project and it was not the best money either. So why doing it anyway? Ok, it paid the bills and allowed me to bootstrap my business. No shame in doing it. But in the long run, this is not what I am chasing.

Being hired as an expert gives you a real upper hand on regular employees when it comes to working on difficult projects where staffing can be difficult. Of course, it requires that you spend time to educate yourself in order to be that expert that people are willing to pay for.


Once you are in, you should be set to work on a technology that you like, on a technology that you know, for a cool project that you have considered and where people are listening to you. Cherry on the cake? You also get to cash in a pretty decent fee for doing the job.
If something above is not here, you just dont work and wait for the next occasion to come.



## What freelance isn't ##

Freelance is a great way to work on what you like while being valued by your customer. But it is not an easy road. It is not an easy way to cash in money, nor an easy way to work very little only relying only on acquired skills. As we will see, freelancing is about sustaining a constent learning in order to be able to choose your customers.
