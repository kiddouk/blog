<p class="intro">Learning how to code has been <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html" target="_blank" title="Jeff Atwood on Coding Horror">discussed</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/10/06/learn-to-code-1-does-everybody-really-need-to-program/" target="_blank" title="Learn to code on forbes">already</a> a million times. Here a 5 reasons why you dont need to learn how to code.</p>

People defending the cause, don't even know what they are talking about.

Nope, coding will not help you to stop whining or have to go to the repair shop at times. Programming and fixing a computer are two different activities. And you dont need to learn one to master the other.

Any activity is "empowering"

What are we affraid here ? That someone is more "empowered" than somebody else ? In that case, I want to learn how to do plumbering.

Coding has nothing to do with coding.
--------------------------------

You read me well. Coding is simply an expression. Trust me, if developers didn't have to code, they wouldn't do it. Solving problems or creating new things comes first by rationalising any given problem. Putting together maths, algorythmics, science and randomness. Coding is just expressing it. Teach a soon-to-be plumber how to solder *before* teaching him how a pipe works and you will spend 1000$ on a sunday night for nothing. :-)

The campaign is widely used by people in the industry to recruit you
---------------------------------
The [campaign video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc "What school don't teach") is incredibly cheesy but efficient. This video is not selling you that "you should code" but rather selling you the tech world. Would you be a handy man after seeing [that ad](http://www.vanksen.fr/files/old/jpg/hydraulik_bienvenue.jpg "Bienvenue en pologne") ? Answer : No. This is a polish tourism advertisment, not a handy man workshop. Note : The guy is damn sexy (Sexier than the average developer). Same goes for the previous video.

Coding is not the right tool to be a rockstar.
---------------------------------
We could totally imagine the following quotes, after watching the [cheesy video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc "What school don't teach on youtube")

> If I knew how to code, I wouldn't have taken any drugs. Think about it. It would have ruined my career.

<p class="author"><i>Curt Cobain, after his death.</i></p>

> Who gives a damn about coding when you can get all the whisky in the world.

<p class="author"><i>Amy winehouse, before dying.</i></p>


More seriously, the "Learn to code" campaign appears to be more [a campaign to hire](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/04/announcing-the-good-things-come-to-those-who-code-campaign.html "A VC") than to really promote a passion or stimulate curiosity or creativity. Make sure that you are learning something that *you* find interesting before caving in front of the hype of a certain field.

Learn things that you are crazy about, things that makes you wonder, things that keep you awake at night. Not some random stuff propulsed by any marketing campaign.
