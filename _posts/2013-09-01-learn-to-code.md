<p class="intro">About a year ago, a new “movement” started to promote learning how to code. Of course, the tech startup world has been a very proud advocate. Let's see why this is a very bad idea.</p>


Yay or Nay ?
------------
First things first, coding – or programming – is a simple exression of a rational idea. You – the non developers – should see it as a medium to express ideas, implement concept and put “stuff in production”. Trust me, if we had any other way to create software, we would do it without having to code. Even better, we would be happier not to have to do it.

Is coding really solving a problem ?
------------------------------------

No. It is not. when you develop a software, web service, or any script, you are trying to address a problem. That problem is:

 1. rationalised at least the developer’s head (if not on paper),
 2. its solution is too
 3. the good tool is selected to solve the problem

    if and only if the good tool is programming :

 4. developer starts coding classes and magical stuff with rabits in his hats and bring automgic things to life.

Note that the 4th step – aka the coding part – is dependant of the result of 3
other, major steps.

Re-read the last paragraph. Coding is the LAST steps of a long series of brain
demanding activities to address a certain problem.

What people think ?
-------------------
Reading that the mayor of New York is “learning how to code”, or reading that the
Copenhagen startup community gets excited about “learning how to code” is as
interesting as me telling you that I am learning how to “how to buy bread” or
again, “how to clean my apartment”. You couldn’t care less. Same goes with how to
code. What is interesting is how you can address some problems.

How did we get there ? The misconceptions.
------------------------------------------
Some people seems to understand “coding” the wrong way.

That’s the thing. You wont fix your computer by learning how to code. Some
other people see “coding” as an empowering capability.

Well so is using a hammer. The hammer wont make you a house builder.
Unfortunately. Learning how to build a house, in regard, will.

All in all, it seems that there is a huge proportion of people who are thinking:
If only I could do that myself. And address the problem by : Hey ! I should
code it.

Instead of learning how to code, start learning mathematics, then start learning
algorythmics, then eventually, learn how to code. You dont teach a house builder
how to use a hammer. You teach him how a house should be shaped so it doesn’t
fall at the first light wind. You dont teach a designer how to use phoitshop at
first, you teach him how to pick colors, have a great sense of typography. You
dont teach a mecanics how to use a screw driver, you teach him what a V engine is.

So, stop learning how to code and go learn what you are missing, a good, and
strong mathematical foundation followed by some good algorithmics.
