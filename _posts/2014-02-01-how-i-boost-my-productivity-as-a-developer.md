title: How I boost my productivity as a developer.

<p class="intro">Every single developer want to be more
productive. Here are my tips on how I increased mine. I have been
working from home for about 4 years and at first it was not that easy
to be productive.</p>

## Get rid of the annoying stuff ##

If you have one thing to remember about that blog post, get rid of the
annoying stuff the first hour in the morning.  Commit the *first hour*
of your day to get rid of everything that is on the way. It can be
paying a simple bill, or that mail that you forgot to reply or even
that annoying administrative paper you have to fill up. We tend to
postpone what we find annoying. Annoying things stack up and are in
the back of your head. Getting rid of all the tasks that you have
postponed for so long will free your mind. No need to think about it
anymore.

Do it for one hour at most, each day.

Say goodbye to guilt and say hello to free brain time. \o/

## Know you tools and improve them ##

You know it, I became a huge defender of Emacs. Some people will tell
you that you will spend more time configuring your Emacs rather than
using it. It's arguably true. But people tend to miss the point. 
By doing so, you are adapting the most precious tool you 
have to your needs, instead of spending time adapting to your
tool. Note that this is not bound to Emacs and you can do the same
with many many other text editors. The point is, while developing,
there always has been some stuff that annoyed me. For example, I
wanted a way to re-run my unit tests automatically on my machine each
time I modified more than 10% of a file. This is now history. My Emacs
does it, and report back to me only when things get dirty. I also like
 documented functions. I made sure that I have the proper
templates in place for function documentations upfront in my code
using [yasnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet). Every
time you run into a small *repetitive* annoyance in your work flow,
address it with a little piece of code (or configuration). In the long
run, it will give you time to focus on what it is important: crafting
your code.

## Use an offline TO-DO list ##

This one is tricky. I use the
[bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com) at the moment to keep track
of my TODOs. I could have used a [fancy](http://todoist.com)
[online](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) tool that connects with my
phone and so on. But I chose an offline / analog TODO list for 2
reasons:

1. I want to be able to forget my TODO list. A moleskin notebook is
transportable, yet, you wont have it with you all the time.
2. I want to re-write tasks that I postpone because.

Re-writing the tasks that you haven't done yesterday to your today's
list gives you the real importance of a task. If you haven't done it,
it may not be that important. Can it be postponed even further ? Or
you realize that things will burn if you don't do that task this
morning. By re-writing, you re-assess the importance of a task.


## There is two level of importance only ##

I tend to see people categorizing things like "not important", "not so
important", "important", "very important", "urgent". This is the wrong
way. It should be "to be done" and "URGENT". I treat any "URGENT" as
the next coming task, disregarding the others. If it's _urgent_, it's
your priority number #1. If it's "to be done" (that's why it's on your
list after all) you have to do it as soon as there is no urgent
matter. That's it. Don't spend 2 hours categorizing your tasks. You
*know* if something is burning or not. Just take the extinguisher and
kill the fire. Right away.


Being productive one day is a simple thing to do, being productive 5
days out of 7 is way more difficult. I tend to apply these four
principles only to make sure that my head is always empty when I need
to relax or when I need to focus on coding. And for that, you need to
get rid of any annoyance.
